# EK301-Truss-Project
Repository includes student made code for calculating tension and compression forces in simple trusses.
Only compressive buckling is taken into account of the failure of a member in a truss.
Any material can be used as long as the Critical Load constant and weight per unit length ratio is defined
Deadload is accounted for, and has the option to be turned off in your truss design .m files.
